about=Local Software connects two previously separate ways of looking at the world digitally; Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Computer-Aided Design (CAD). Local Software systematically connects what we know about the world to what we make in it. This Local Software QGIS Plugin imports, exports, or makes a set of geoJSON site packages with QGIS. Site packages can be imported into Rhino with Grasshopper Local Software components.
